As a part of my work with the [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) team in [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), I contributed to a project called Aptly. Aptly is an extension of the MIT App Inventor platform that enables mobile app development through natural language commands. Aptly allows users to describe their desired app functionality in plain text, and have their description translated into App Inventor's block-based programming interface. The system utilizes the OpenAI API for code generation, and includes an Aptly server that processes user inputs along with a real-time collaboration (RTC) feature that allows dynamic app modification. Aptly makes it more accessible for users without prior programming experience to create funtional mobile applications. I contributed to the project by creating the initial demo video showcasing Aptlyâ€™s capabilities, which was featured in the blog post to introduce the project. In addition, I focused on enhancing the backend of the system to support a wider range of App Inventor blocks, enabling the creation of more complex applications.
