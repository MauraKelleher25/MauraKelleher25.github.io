In May 2025, I will graduate from MIT with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering [(Course 6-3)](https://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/), a minor in Business Analytics [(Course 15-2)](https://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/business-analytics-course-15-2/) and concentration in [Science, Technology and Society](https://catalog.mit.edu/schools/humanities-arts-social-sciences/science-technology-society/). Concurrently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science through the [MIT MEng program](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/meng-program/). My thesis, under the guidance of MIT Professor [Aude Oliva](http://olivalab.mit.edu/audeoliva.html) and [Rogerio Ferris](https://www.rogerioferis.org/) of IBM, focuses on video-to-prosody models for sports applications.

I am an incoming Computer Vision Intern at augmented reality gaming company [Niantic](https://nianticlabs.com/?hl=en). In my previous summer at Niantic, I was working on the AR Mapping and World Perception team, retraining novel depth estimation models for improved long-range reconstruction of 3D scenes. My past experiences also include machine learning work for biotechnology company [BiomX](https://www.biomx.com/), and research and development for edtech platform [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/). I've also contributed to the [MIT Media Lab's Fluid Interfaces](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/overview/) group, where I built a full-stack web application for a sleep study investigating the impact of wearable technology on memory and cognition.
