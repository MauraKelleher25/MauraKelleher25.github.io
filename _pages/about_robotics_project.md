[6.4210](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/Fall2023/) is a course at MIT that covers algorithmic approaches for autonomous robotic manipulation in unstructured environments, covering perception, planning, and control. For our final project, we developed a full-stack robotic system capable of creating detailed and expressive sketches of 3D objects in simulation. The system addresses key challenges such as extracting reliable drawing trajectories from visual data, generating precise motion control to replicate artistic strokes, and optimizing the drawing process for intricate details. Our approach consists of three major components: transforming images into clean sketches using deep learning models, generating optimal drawing trajectories from vectorized sketches, and fine-tuning the robot's motion to dynamically control stroke width based on contact forces. The project was implemented using a simulation environment with a robotic arm and gripper, leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, trajectory planning, and motion optimization in [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/).
